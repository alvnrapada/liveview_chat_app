To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Before going to the liveview chat app, first you need to:

  * Register atleast 2 users 
  * Sign in one of your user to incognito or other browser (to check liveview functionality) 
  * Go to: http://localhost:4000/chat

Right now I automatically created chat conversations based on the number of users, 
so you can quickly check its functionality
